**Sam (Research & Development)**: As a Research and Development point person, I spend a lot of my time doing academic research on the topic of tinyML and what usually happens is that it typically ends up in a paper. However, here at HOT-G, it is very cool to see it being built into a product. We are designing stuff that can actually be used by a lot of people.

**Akshay (CEO, Founder)**: There are a few waves in computing that change the paradigm of how we see the world going forward. You can think of the PC era, internet, deep learning, decentralization, and now we are entering the era of the “Internet of Tiny Thinking Things.” It is an exciting time for us to be at the forefront of this wave and with a team that is already exceptional in this space makes it even more amazing.
