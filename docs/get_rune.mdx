Rune and the dependant toolchains used to generate bytecode require some dependencies. To make it 
easier to use you can leverage docker! Our images are available on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tinyverseml).

## Docker (Recommended)

### Rune Cli

You can use `docker run` to use `rune-cli` directly in your local directory. The following shell script will execute `rune-cli` using volumes in your local directory.
```
#! sh
docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd`  -i -t tinyverseml/rune-cli /usr/local/bin/rune $@%   
```

Save the shell script in your PATH variable and you are ready to go!

### Rune-Serve
Similarly the rune-serve tool is also available as a docker container and can be run with the following command:

```
docker run -e RUST_LOG=INFO -v `pwd`:/app/static tinyverseml/rune-serve
```

** Note about Apple M1 **

Currently Docker on M1 is still unstable and is not supported! We are working on this actively follow our progress
on (github)[https://github.com/hotg-ai/rune/issues/174].  

** Note about Windows **
