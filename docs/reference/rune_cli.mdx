The `rune` CLI tool is the primary way most people will develop Runes.

# Model Info (`rune model-info`)

The first step when integrating a TensorFlow Lite model into a Rune is to figure
out what data it receives as input and what it generates as output.

Often this information will already be known (e.g. because the model was
developed in-house or well documented), but it is also possible to use the
`rune model-info` sub-command to inspect a TensorFlow Lite model.

```console
$ rune model-info --help
Load a TensorFlow Lite model and print information about it

USAGE:
    rune model-info [OPTIONS] <file>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -f, --format <format>    The format to print output in (supported: json, text) [default: text]

ARGS:
    <file>    The TensorFlow Lite model to inspect
```

## The Model (`<file>`)

The mode file is a required positional argument pointing to a valid TensorFlow
Lite file.

## Output Format (`--format`)

By default, the model's inputs and outputs will be presented in a human-readable
format. This is the equivalent of using the `--format text` option.

```console
$ rune model-info ./yamnet.tflite
Ops: 114
Inputs:
	waveform: Float32[1]
Outputs:
	Identity: Float32[1, 521]
	Identity_1: Float32[1, 1024]
	Identity_2: Float32[1, 64]
```

The `--format json` flag can be provided to get a more machine-friendly version.

```console
$ rune model-info microspeech.tflite --format json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "Reshape",
      "element_kind": "Int8",
      "dims": [
        1,
        1960
      ]
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "labels_softmax",
      "element_kind": "Int8",
      "dims": [
        1,
        6
      ]
    }
  ],
  "ops": 4
}
```

In either case, the `inputs` and `outputs` properties specify the tensor
dimensions and element types used as input/output. The `element_kind` property
is specified in the [` tensorflow/tensorflow/lite/c/c_api_types.h `][data-type]
header file, with types named similarly to that used in [the `outputs` section](./runefile_yml.mdx#outputs)
of a Runefile.

# Build (`rune build`)

The `rune build` sub-command will parse a Runefile and generate an equivalent
project in Rust so it can be compiled to WebAssembly.

```console
$ rune build --help
Compile a Runefile into a Rune

USAGE:
    rune build [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [runefile]

FLAGS:
        --debug      Compile the Rune without optimisations
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --cache-dir <cache-dir>        The directory to use when caching builds [env: CACHE_DIR=]
    -c, --current-dir <current-dir>    The directory that all paths are resolved relative to (Defaults to the Runefile's
                                       directory) [env: CURRENT_DIR=]
    -n, --name <name>                  The name of the Rune (defaults to the Runefile directory's name)
    -o, --output <output>              Where to write the generated Rune

ARGS:
    <runefile>    The Runefile to compile [default: Runefile.yml]
```

## The Runefile (`<runefile>`)

The name of the runefile being compiled. This is the only positional argument
and will default to `Runefile.yml` in the current directory.

## The Cache Directory (`--cache-dir`)

The `--cache-dir` argument is used to specify a temporary directory that the
Rune project will be written to and compiled in. If not specified then
a rune named `sine` would use the `runes/sine/` directory inside
the operating system's native cache directory.


| Platform | OS Cache Directory                  | Example                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `$HOME`/.cache | `/home/alice/.cache/runes/sine`           |
| macOS    | `$HOME`/Library/Caches              | `/Users/Alice/Library/Caches/runes/sine`  |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}`           | `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local\runes\sine` |

## The Current Directory (`--current-directory`)

The `--current-directory` argument specifies which directory to use when
resolving relative paths in a Runefile. By default it will be the directory the
Runefile is located in.

## Name (`--name`)

Each Rune can be given a name which alters things like the name of the generated
Rust project and the label attached to any log messages emitted by the Rune. By
default, the name of the Runefile's directory will be used.

## Output File (`--output`)

The `--output` argument specifies where the generated Rune will be saved to. By
default it will be the [`name`](#name) with the `.rune` extension (e.g.
`microspeech.rune`).

## Debug Mode (`--debug`)

A Rune can be compiled with debug assertions enabled and without optimisations
using the `--debug` flag.

This is typically used when working on a new proc block because it enables more
useful stacktraces (stack frames won't be inlined away) and lets the author
perform more assertions that are too expensive to be present in a release build
but may be helpful during development.

Compiling a Rune in debug mode will often be faster than release mode (the
default), however Runes dealing with larger amounts of data may become
unacceptably slow to execute.

# Run (`rune run`)

The `rune run` sub-command takes a compiled Rune and runs it. This
specified capabilities as inputs.

This is typically done when an engineer is prototyping locally or wanting an
easy way to run Runes on a server. For most other use cases, application
engineers will gain more fine-grained control by embedding a Rune Virtual
Machine directly into their applications.

```console
$ rune run -h
Run a rune

USAGE:
    rune run [OPTIONS] <rune>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --capability <capabilities>...    Pass information to a capability as `key:value` pairs
    -r, --repeats <repeats>               The number of times to execute this rune [default: 1]

ARGS:
    <rune>    The Rune to run
```

## The Rune (`<rune>`)

The Rune file is a required argument pointing to a valid Rune on disk.

## Capabilities (`--capability`)

By design, the only way to pass information into a Rune is via [a
*Capability*][cap].  The syntax for specifying a capability is `--capability
image:person.png`, where the `--capability` parameter can be passed multiple
times and its value is in the form, `key:value`.

```console
$ run gesture.rune --capability accel:example_ring.csv
```

The capabilities supported by the `rune` CLI are:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Input/Extension</th>

                </ul>
